read() attempts to read nbyte bytes of data from the object referenced by
     the descriptor fildes into the buffer pointed to by buf.\n  readv() per-
     forms the same action, but scatters the input data into the iovcnt
     buffers specified by the members of the iov array: iov[0], iov[1], ...,
     iov[iovcnt-1].\n  pread() performs the same function, but reads from the
     specified position in the file without modifying the file pointer.\n
